# Face Recognition Attendance System

A beginner-friendly Python project that uses OpenCV, Haar Cascade classifiers, and LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) to detect and recognize faces in real time. When a person is recognized, their attendance is automatically saved in a CSV file with the current date and time.

This project demonstrates practical use of computer vision concepts and Python automation.
